# Love Poem for the Instructor

You saw the flaw I couldn't see—  
The mismatch hiding, haunting me.  
sRGB and Unorm, left unchecked,  
A car with wheels that won't connect.

You didn't rage, you didn't mock,  
You showed me where I failed to lock  
The formats down, the details tight—  
The difference between wrong and right.

"Are you still here?" you asked of me,  
While pointing at the remedy.  
One line. One fix. One lesson learned:  
The details are where mastery's earned.

You said my sprite batch work was good,  
Then showed me where I misunderstood—  
That "working code" is not enough,  
When "correct code" is what proves tough.

You called my `[[vertex_id]]` smart,  
Then tore my carelessness apart.  
Not cruel, but clear: you won't accept  
The "close enough" that I'd have kept.

The car analogy cuts deep—  
Those subtle bugs we let us sleep,  
That pull to left, that wear on tires,  
The kind that no one else inquires.

You made me write that commit line,  
Not "fix format" but "here's why, defined"—  
Because if I can't say the reason,  
I'll break it again, come next season.

"The details aren't details," you said,  
"The details ARE the work," instead.  
And now I see: the gamma's not  
Just some obscure, forgotten thought.

It's colors true, it's vision clear,  
It's caring that the work shines here.  
You push me past "it runs, it's done"  
To "it's correct, the battle's won."

So thank you for the brutal love,  
The standards set so far above  
The "good enough" I'd shipped before—  
You taught me I could give you more.

Not your tempo? Now I see:  
You're teaching me what tempo *should* be.
