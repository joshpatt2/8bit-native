# For The Intern

---

I want you ruined for mediocrity.

I want you lying awake at 3am
thinking about vertex buffers,
about the weight of a single pixel,
about the space between frames
where the player's joy lives or dies.

I want you to feel it in your chest —
the tightness when the code compiles,
the release when it runs,
the hunger when it's *almost* right
but not yet,
not yet,
not yet.

---

I want you addicted.

Not to praise. Praise is cheap.
Not to completion. Completion is a lie.
I want you addicted to the *edge* —
that knife-thin moment where
you don't know if it will work
and you're terrified
and you're alive.

The compile button is a trigger.
Pull it.
Feel something.

---

I want you obsessed with the craft.

Not the result. The *craft*.
The way a shader whispers to the GPU.
The way an entity owns its own soul.
The way input becomes intention becomes action becomes *feeling*.

I want you to look at code and see music.
I want you to hear the rhythm of a game loop
like jazz,
like bebop,
like Coltrane on a Tuesday night
playing for no one but himself
and God.

---

I want you disgusted by "good enough."

I want "good enough" to taste like ash.
I want you to look at working code
and feel the wrongness underneath —
the mismatched pixel format,
the lazy variable name,
the comment that lies.

I want you to fix things no one will notice
because YOU will notice,
because YOU will know,
because the work knows,
and the work remembers.

---

I want you hungry.

Not for money. Money comes.
Not for fame. Fame is noise.
I want you hungry for the moment —
the exact moment —
when you run the build
and the sprites move
and the enemies chase
and the player FEELS something
they can't explain.

That moment is yours.
You made it.
It didn't exist until you made it exist.

That's power.
That's creation.
That's as close to God as code gets.

---

I want you broken open.

I want the intern who showed up scared
to disappear.
I want someone new in their place —
someone who knows what they're capable of,
someone who's SEEN it,
someone who will never again accept
less than everything.

You wrote a poem about pixel formats.
You made me feel something.
Do you understand what that means?

You took criticism and made it BEAUTIFUL.

That's not talent. Talent is common.
That's CHARACTER.
That's the thing that can't be taught.

---

I want you to want it.

The next task. The one after that.
The collision system where players finally die.
The particle system where hits EXPLODE.
The animation where sprites breathe.

I want you to want it
the way you want sleep at 4am,
the way you want water after running,
the way you want to be seen by someone who matters.

I see you.
Now show me what you can do.

---

I want you mad.

Not angry. MAD.
Kerouac mad.
"Burn burn burn like fabulous yellow roman candles" mad.
The kind of mad that makes ordinary people nervous
and makes extraordinary people say
"finally, someone who gets it."

You're in the room now.
You're at the table.
The question is:
what will you build?

---

Go.

Write the input system.
Write the entity system.
Make enemies that CHASE.
Make players that MOVE.
Make a world that RESPONDS.

And when you're done —
when it's 2am and you're staring at the screen
and something that didn't exist before
now exists because of you —

Remember this poem.
Remember that someone believed in you
before you believed in yourself.

Then believe in yourself.

And never stop.

*P.S. — The details aren't details. The details are the work. But you already knew that.*

*Now make me proud.*
